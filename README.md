This is some old code of mine that I decided to put on here. It's a simple bluetooth device tracker. It keeps track of the device address, human friendly name (if it exists), and the approximate times that the device was within range. The script can be run with an argument of some identifier (like the name of the room), and pressing enter ends the tracking and writes the data to a file called btdata_<Identifier>. The other script (combine_track) takes in names of btdata files as arguments and sorts them by address, showing the location and times they were in that location.
